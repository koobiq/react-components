# Responsive UI

The instructions below describe how to use adaptive interfaces using Koobiq React.

Koobiq React provides the following breakpoints by default:

```js
export const defaultBreakpoints: Breakpoints = {
  xs: 0, // (min-width: 0px)
  s: 480, // (min-width: 480px)
  m: 768, // (min-width: 768px)
  l: 1024, // (min-width: 1024px)
  xl: 1280, // (min-width: 1280px)
  xxl: 1536 // (min-width: 1536px)
};
```

## Default breakpoints

The `Provider` component helps you manage responsive breakpoints in your app.

### Usage

- Wrap the application with the `Provider` component to enable responsive breakpoints.
- Access the breakpoints object from the `useBreakpoints` hook in your component.

### Server-Side Rendering

<Alert status="warning">
  Server-side rendering and client-side media queries are fundamentally at odds.
  Be aware of the tradeoff. The support can only be partial.
</Alert>

Use `breakpointsFallback` on the server because media queries can't run without a real screen.
It provides default values for breakpoints during server-side rendering to ensure consistent UI on first load.

You can set values for `breakpointsFallback` using the userAgent, for example to check if it's a phone or a desktop.
But this gives only a basic idea of the device. If you need more accurate results, it's better to use
[CSS media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries).

```tsx
import { Provider } from '@koobiq/react-components';

const App = () => (
  // On the server, all breakpoints up to size "l" will be considered active
  <Provider breakpointsFallback={[true, true, true, true]}>
    My application
  </Provider>
);
```

### Example

```tsx
import { Provider, useBreakpoints } from '@koobiq/react-components';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { xs, l } = useBreakpoints();

  return (
    <div>
      {xs && <p>Extra small screen active!</p>}
      {l && <p>Large screen active!</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => (
  <Provider>
    <MyComponent />
  </Provider>
);
```

## Responsive Components

Many components like [Grid](?path=/docs/components-grid--docs#responsive-values-1), [FlexBox](?path=/docs/components-flexbox--docs#responsive-values),
and [Form](?path=/docs/components-form--docs) support responsive props.
They can take a single value, or an object where each breakpoint key has its own value.

This way your layout works well on any device.

Example:

```tsx
// Single value: works the same on all screen sizes
<FlexBox
  gap="xs"
  direction="column"
/>

// Object with breakpoints: values change depending on screen size
<FlexBox
  gap={{ xs: 'xl', l: '6xl' }}
  direction={{ xs: 'column', l: 'row' }}
/>
```

## useMediaQuery

The [useMediaQuery](?path=/docs/hooks-usemediaquery--docs) hook is a CSS media query hook for React. It listens for matches to a CSS media query,
allowing you to dynamically respond to changes in screen size or other media features.
