# Deprecation Strategy

The design-system team aims to maintain backward compatibility when updating components. However, this isn't always possible.

We deprecate components in our library when:

- A new component is available that replaces the old one.
- There's a better way to solve the same problem.

We understand that replacing a deprecated component takes time and effort.
That's why we provide a clear and safe strategy to help teams transition with minimal risk and at a comfortable pace.

## Dual support

If a component is deprecated and a replacement is available, the new version will be named with the `Next` prefix.
For example, if `Component` is deprecated, the replacement will be called `ComponentNext`.

This allows continued development of similar new components while avoiding the necessity to do a breaking
version change in the library.

During the next major version release we would delete the deprecated component and drop Next from the new component.

## Documenting deprecations

See details on how to annotate components for deprecation.

**Deprecating components**

To deprecate a component in the library, the component export
should be annotated with a JSDoc comment including the `@deprecated`.

```tsx
/**
 * Description of the component goes here.
 *
 * @deprecated
 * This component has been deprecated, please use ComponentNext instead.
 */
const Component = () => {
  // Some component
};
```

In the documentation, highlight that the component is no longer supported and link to the new one:

<Alert status="error" title="This component has been deprecated">
  Please use <Link>ComponentNext</Link> instead.
</Alert>

**Deprecating props**

To deprecate a prop on a component, the types should be updated to be annotated with a JSDOC
comment included the `@deprecated`.

```tsx
import { deprecate } from '@koobiq/logger';

type ComponentProps = {
  /**
   * Description of the prop goes here.
   *
   * @deprecated
   * The "legacyProp" prop is deprecated. Use "nextProp" prop to replace it.
   */
  legacyProp?: string;
  // ...
};

const Component = (props) => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' && 'legacyProp' in props) {
    deprecate(
      'Component: the "legacyProp" prop is deprecated. Use "nextProp" prop to replace it.'
    );
  }

  // ...
};
```
