# Roadmap

The design system team is releasing a library with a major version zero
([0.y.z](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4)). This means it's still in early
development and mainly for testing and trying out. Things can change at any
time, and the component API is not stable yet.

**However, even though the version is 0.y.z, we keep backward compatibility
for components that are in the stable stage. This means that when a component
becomes [stable](?path=/docs/component-lifecycle--docs), we don't make changes
that break apps that use it.**

The Koobiq React team is happy to get [feedback](?path=/docs/feedback--docs)
from anyone who wants to try the design-system in their projects.
We really appreciate your thoughts and suggestions.

You can find the list of components and available features in the current
version of the library in the roadmap below.

Also, check out other articles in the list below:

- [Component Lifecycle](?path=/docs/component-lifecycle--docs)
- [Deprecation Strategy](?path=/docs/deprecation-strategy--docs)

## Development Strategy

We build components based on how important and how often they are used:

- First, we make the most important and commonly used components â€” the basics for most UIs.
- Then, we add more complex or optional components that improve the experience.

**This step-by-step approach helps us keep the system clean, reusable, and easy to grow as the product changes.**

## Roadmap 2024-2025

of the library in the roadmap below. It shows the current status, development stage,
