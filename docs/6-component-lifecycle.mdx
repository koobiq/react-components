# Component Lifecycle

Components progress through the following development stages: **Draft**, **Experimental**, **Stable**, and **Deprecated**.

## Draft

<Status variant="draft" />

Draft components are in the early stages of design and have not yet been added to the official specification.

## Experimental

<Status variant="experimental" />

Experimental components are actively developed and available for beta testing.

- They may not meet quality standards and could lack sufficient documentation.
- The public API is unstable and subject to change.
- Breaking changes may occur even in minor updates.

## Stable

<Status variant="stable" />

Stable components are fully developed, backward compatible, and supported long-term.

- They follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), with changes to the API being rare and predictable.
- These components meet quality standards and are safe for production use.

## Deprecated

<Status variant="deprecated" />

Deprecated components are stable but scheduled for removal in a future major release.

- They log a deprecation warning during local development when used.
- No updates or bug fixes will be provided.
- Users should transition to the recommended alternatives as outlined in the documentation.
