# Badge

<Status variant="experimental" />

Badge is used to highlight the status, quantity, or other important characteristics of an object.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

<Props />

## Size

For compact or normal badges, use the `size` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Size} />

## Variant

Use the `variant` property to set the view of component.

<Story of={Stories.Variant} />

## With Icons

You can add an icon using the `startIcon` and `endIcon` property.

Both properties expect an icon component from our [icon library](?path=/docs/icons--docs).

<Story of={Stories.WithIcons} />

## Long label

The text in the badge is always placed in one line.

If the badge doesn't fit into the parent container in width, it is compressed,
the text in the label is cut off and an ellipsis is added at the end.

<Story of={Stories.LongLabel} />
