# Tabs

## Scrolling

When tabs don't fit on one line, they don't wrap and can be scrolled horizontally.
You can scroll with a trackpad or mouse wheel, or use the previous and next buttons to reveal hidden tabs.

<Story of={Stories.Scrolling} />

<Status variant="experimental" />

Tabs organize content into multiple sections and allow users to navigate between them.

```tsx
import { Tabs, Tab } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Subcomponents

- `Tabs`: The main component to display a tab list.
- `Tab`: The component to display a tab item. The children of this component will be displayed as the content of the tab.

## Dynamic

You can render tabs dynamically by using `items` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Dynamic} />

## Vertical

Set the tabs to vertical by passing `orientation="vertical"` to `Tabs`.

<Story of={Stories.Vertical} />

## Underlined

Enable underlined tabs using the `isUnderlined` prop and note that vertical orientation is not supported for this variant.

<Story of={Stories.Underlined} />

## Full width

Set the `fullWidth` prop to true to make all tabs expand and share the available space evenly.

<Story of={Stories.FullWidth} />

## With icons

<Story of={Stories.WithIcons} />

## Custom tab title

<Story of={Stories.CustomTabTitle} />

## Disabled

All tabs within a `Tabs` can be disabled using the `isDisabled` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Disabled Item

Tabs supports marking items as disabled using the `disabledKeys` prop.
Each key in this list corresponds with the `key` prop passed to the `Tab` component.

<Story of={Stories.DisabledItem} />

## Controlled

You can use the `onSelectionChange` and `selectedKey` props to control the selected tab.

<Story of={Stories.Controlled} />

## Links

Tabs items can be rendered as links by passing the `href` prop to the `Tab` component.
By default, links perform native browser navigation.

However, you'll usually want to synchronize the selected tab with the current
URL from your client side router. You can do this by doing the following:

- Set up your router at the root of your app.
- Use the `selectedKey` prop to set the selected tab based on the current URL.

## With Form
