# DatePicker

<Status variant="experimental" />

A date picker combines a DateInput and a Calendar popover to allow users to enter or select a date and time value.

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Value

A DatePicker displays a placeholder by default. An initial, uncontrolled value can be provided
to the DatePicker using the `defaultValue` prop. Alternatively, a controlled value can be provided
using the `value` prop.

Date values are provided using objects in the [@internationalized/date](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/tree/main/packages/@internationalized/date) package.
This library handles correct international date manipulation across calendars,
time zones, and other localization concerns.

### Uncontrolled

<Story of={Stories.Uncontrolled} />

### Controlled

<Story of={Stories.Controlled} />

## States

Use `isDisabled`, `isInvalid`, `isRequired`, and `isReadOnly` to show the component in different states.
You can also add a `caption` to provide extra context about the date picker.

<Story of={Stories.States} />

## Full width

The `fullWidth` prop will make an input fit to its parent width.

<Story of={Stories.FullWidth} />

## Open

### Default open

DatePicker isn't opened by default. The `defaultOpen` prop can be used to set the default state.

### Controlled open

The `isOpen` prop can be used to make the opened state controlled. The `onOpenChange` event is fired when the date picker's open state changes.

<Story of={Stories.Open} />

## Locale

By default, the DatePicker uses the user's system locale.
To set a custom locale, wrap your component with [Provider](?path=/docs/components-provider--docs)
and pass the `locale` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Locale} />

## Min and Max values

By default, DatePicker allows selecting any date. The `minValue` and `maxValue` props can also be used to prevent
the user from selecting dates outside a certain range.

<Story of={Stories.MinMaxValues} />

## Unavailable dates

DatePicker supports marking certain dates as unavailable.
These dates remain focusable with the keyboard so that navigation is consistent,
but cannot be selected by the user.

The `isDateUnavailable` prop accepts a callback that is called to evaluate
whether each visible date is unavailable.

<Story of={Stories.UnavailableDates} />
