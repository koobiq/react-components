# SearchInput

<Status variant="experimental" />

A search input allows a user to enter and clear a search query.

```tsx
import { SearchInput } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Addons

You can add an extra content using the `startAddon` and `endAddon` props.

<Story of={Stories.Addons} />

## Variant

To change the visual state of the search input, use the `variant` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Variant} />

## Invalid

The `isInvalid` prop toggles the error state. The `errorMessage` shows a message to explain the error to the user.

<Story of={Stories.Invalid} />

## Disabled

A search input can be disabled by passing the `isDisabled` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Required

To make a field required, add the `isRequired` prop.
If the field has a label, a required indicator will appear next to it.

<Story of={Stories.Required} />

## Read only

The `isReadOnly` boolean prop makes the component text content immutable.
Unlike `isDisabled`, the component remains focusable and the contents can still be copied.
See the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) for more information.

<Story of={Stories.ReadOnly} />

## Full width

The `fullWidth` prop will make a search input fit to its parent width.

<Story of={Stories.FullWidth} />

## Label placement and alignment

Use `labelPlacement` and `labelAlign` props to set the position of the label.

See [Create a form](?path=/docs/components-input--docs#create-a-form) story for a two column form with a shared label column.

<Story of={Stories.LabelPlacementAlignment} />

## Events

The most commonly used handlers for events in `SearchInput` are the:

- `onChange` prop which is triggered whenever the value is edited by the user.
- `onSubmit` prop which is triggered whenever the value is submitted by the user (e.g. by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>).
- `onClear` prop which is triggered whenever the value is cleared by the user (e.g. by pressing clear button or <kbd>Escape</kbd> key).

The example below uses `onChange`, `onSubmit`, and `onClear` to update two separate elements with the text entered into the SearchInput.

<Story of={Stories.Events} />

## Debounce Search

Use the [useDebounceCallback](?path=/docs/hooks-usedebouncecallback--docs) hook to add a delay to input changes.

This helps avoid calling the handler on every keystroke.

<Story of={Stories.DebounceSearch} />
