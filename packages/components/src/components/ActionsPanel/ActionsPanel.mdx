# ActionsPanel

<Status variant="experimental" />

ActionsPanel is used for single and bulk selection patterns when
a user needs to perform actions on one or more items at the same time.

```tsx
import { ActionsPanel, ActionsPanelContainer } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

<Props />

## Components

Use these components to build a contextual actions panel that appears when items are selected.

- `ActionsPanelContainer` — A wrapper that provides a portal container for the panel overlay and controls where the panel is rendered.
- `ActionsPanel` — The main panel. Shows as an overlay when `selectedItemCount > 0`, handles keyboard dismissal, and calls `onClearSelection` to close.
- `ActionsPanel.Action` — An action item inside the panel. Actions can be automatically collapsed into the overflow menu when there isn't enough space.

## Overflow

<Story of={Stories.Overflow} />

## Extra Count

<Story of={Stories.ExtraCount} />

## Standalone

<Story of={Stories.Standalone} />
