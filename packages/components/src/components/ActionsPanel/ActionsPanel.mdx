# ActionsPanel

<Status variant="experimental" />

ActionsPanel is used for single and bulk selection patterns when
a user needs to perform actions on one or more items at the same time.

```tsx
import { ActionsPanel, ActionsPanelContainer } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

<Props />

## Components

Use these components to build a contextual actions panel.

- `ActionsPanelContainer` — Wraps the content and hosts the panel.
- `ActionsPanel` — Displays actions for selected items.
- `ActionsPanel.Action` — Defines an individual action.

## Usage

Wrap your page content with `ActionsPanelContainer` — it provides the container for the panel.

Place `ActionsPanel` next to your content. The panel appears when `selectedItemCount > 0`.

Add `ActionsPanel.Action` to define actions for selected items. Each action should have a `key`.
When triggered, `onAction` is called with that key.

```tsx
<ActionsPanelContainer>
  {/* List, Table, or any other content that controls selection */}
  <YourContent />

  <ActionsPanel selectedItemCount={3} onAction={(key) => alert(key)}>
    <ActionsPanel.Action key="action-1">Action 1</ActionsPanel.Action>
    <ActionsPanel.Action key="action-2">Action 2</ActionsPanel.Action>
    <ActionsPanel.Action key="action-3">Action 3</ActionsPanel.Action>
  </ActionsPanel>
</ActionsPanelContainer>
```

## Overflow

<Story of={Stories.Overflow} />

## Additional counter

The component supports an optional secondary counter via the `selectedExtraCount` prop.

This counter is displayed next to `selectedItemCount` and can be used to show additional context.
For example, if items are grouped, it can represent the total number of items instead of just selected groups.

<Story of={Stories.ExtraCount} />

## Standalone

<Story of={Stories.Standalone} />
