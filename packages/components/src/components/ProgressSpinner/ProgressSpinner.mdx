# ProgressSpinner

<Status variant="experimental" />

ProgressSpinner shows the progression of a system operation such as downloading, uploading, or processing, in a visual way.
They can represent determinate or indeterminate progress.

```tsx
import { ProgressSpinner } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Size

For `compact` or `big` progresses, use the `size` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Size} />

## Value

ProgressBars are controlled with the `value` prop.
By default, the `value` prop represents the current percentage of progress,
as the minimum and maximum values default to 0 and 100, respectively.

<Story of={Stories.Value} />

Alternatively, a different scale can be used by setting the `minValue` and `maxValue` props.

<Story of={Stories.MinMaxValues} />

## Indeterminate

By default, ProgressSpinners are determinate.
Use `isIndeterminate` when progress can't be calculated against a specific goal.

<Story of={Stories.Indeterminate} />

## Loading emulation

See the example with progress loading emulation.

<Story of={Stories.LoadingEmulation} />
