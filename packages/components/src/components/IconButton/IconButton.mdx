# IconButton

<Status variant="experimental" />

The IconButton component integrates icons within buttons, combining the visual appeal of icons with the functionality of buttons.

```tsx
import { IconButton } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Events

IconButton supports user interactions via mouse, keyboard, and touch.
You can handle all of these via the `onPress` prop. This is similar to the standard `onClick` event,
but normalized to support all interaction methods equally.

In addition, the `onPressStart`, `onPressEnd`, and `onPressChange` events are fired as the user interacts with the button.

## Size

For `l` or `xl` buttons, use the `size` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Size} />

## Variant

Use the `variant` prop to set the view of the component.

<Story of={Stories.Variant} />

## Disabled

A button can be disabled by passing the `isDisabled` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Compact

Use the `isCompact` prop to set a compact view of the component.

<Story of={Stories.Compact} />

## Root tag

Use the `as` prop to redefine the HTML-tag of the component to your own.

<Story of={Stories.RootTag} />
