# SkeletonTypography

<Status variant="draft" />

SkeletonTypography is a preview placeholder for text components that haven't loaded yet,
reducing load-time frustration by displaying a temporary text-like shape until the actual content appears.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

For a skeleton of unloaded text, you can set the following properties:

- `rows` – number of lines
- `variant` – typography variant (see [Typography](?path=/docs/components-typography--docs) component)
- `inlineSize` – size of line.

## Example 1

<Story of={Stories.Example1} />

## Example 2

<Story of={Stories.Example2} />
