# Link

<Status variant="experimental" />

The Link component is part of the typography and is used to display
a link or button that visually looks like a hyperlink.

```tsx
import { Link } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Security

When you use `target="_blank"` with Links, it is recommended to always set `rel="noopener"`
or `rel="noreferrer"` when linking to third party content.

- `rel="noopener"` prevents the new page from being able to access the `window.opener` property and ensures it runs in a separate process.
  Without this, the target page can potentially redirect your page to a malicious URL.

- `rel="noreferrer"` has the same effect, but also prevents the Referer header from being sent to the new page.
  Removing the referrer header will affect analytics.

## Variant

To change the visual state of the link, use the `variant` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Variant} />

## With icons

You can add an icon using the `startIcon` and `endIcon` props.

Both props expect an icon component from our [icon library](?path=/docs/icons--docs).

<Story of={Stories.WithIcons} />

## Disabled

A link can be disabled by passing the `isDisabled` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Allow visited

The `allowVisited` prop is used to show that the Link has already been clicked.

<Story of={Stories.AllowVisited} />

## Root tag

Use the `as` property to redefine the HTML-tag of the component to your own.

<Story of={Stories.RootTag} />

## Composition

See an example showing the use of the component in [Typography](?path=/docs/components-typography--docs).

<Story of={Stories.Composition} />

## Integration

### Next.js

Integrating navigation into a Link using Next.js Link:

```tsx
import NextLink from 'next/link';

<Link as={NextLink} href="/some_page">
  Some page
</Link>;
```
