# Link

The Link component is part of the typography and is used to display
a link or button that visually looks like a hyperlink.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

<Props />

## Security

When you use `target="_blank"` with Links, it is recommended to always set `rel="noopener"`
or `rel="noreferrer"` when linking to third party content.

- `rel="noopener"` prevents the new page from being able to access the `window.opener` property and ensures it runs in a separate process.
  Without this, the target page can potentially redirect your page to a malicious URL.

- `rel="noreferrer"` has the same effect, but also prevents the Referer header from being sent to the new page.
  Removing the referrer header will affect analytics.

## Variant

To change the visual state of the link, use the `variant` property.

<Story of={Stories.Variant} />

## With icons

You can add an icon using the `startIcon` and `endIcon` property.

Both properties expect an icon component from our [icon library](?path=/docs/icons--docs).

<Story of={Stories.WithIcons} />

## Disabled

A link can be disabled by passing the `disabled` property.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Visitable

This property is used to show that the Link has already been clicked.

<Story of={Stories.Visitable} />

## Root tag

Use the `as` property to redefine the HTML-tag of the component to your own.

<Story of={Stories.RootTag} />

## Composition

See an example showing the use of the component in [Typography](?path=/docs/components-typography--docs).

<Story of={Stories.Composition} />
