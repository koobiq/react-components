# Button

<Status variant="experimental" />

Button is a clickable UI component that triggers actions or events, styled according to the design-system.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

<Props />

## Variant

To change the visual state of the button, use the `variant` property.

<Story of={Stories.Variant} />

## With icons

You can add an icon using the `startIcon` and `endIcon` property.

Both properties expect an icon component from our [icon library](?path=/docs/icons--docs).

<Story of={Stories.WithIcons} />

## Only icon

A button can only consist of an icon.

<Story of={Stories.OnlyIcon} />

## Progress

Add a progress indicator to a button by using the `progress` property.

<Story of={Stories.Progress} />

## Disabled

A button can be disabled by passing the `disabled` property.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Long label

If the button is too wide for its container, it shrinks, the text gets cut off, and an ellipsis is added at the end.

<Story of={Stories.LongLabel} />

## Full width

The `fullWidth` property will make a button fit to its parent width.

<Story of={Stories.FullWidth} />

## Root tag

Use the `as` property to redefine the HTML-tag of the component to your own.

<Story of={Stories.RootTag} />
