# Input

<Status variant="experimental" />

Input component is a component that is used to get user input in a text field.

```tsx
import { Input } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Addons

You can add an extra content using the `startAddon` and `endAddon` props.

<Story of={Stories.Addons} />

## Variant

To change the visual state of the input, use the `variant` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Variant} />

## Invalid

The `isInvalid` prop toggles the error state. The `errorMessage` shows a message to explain the error to the user.

<Story of={Stories.Invalid} />

## Disabled

An input can be disabled by passing the `isDisabled` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Required

To make a field required, add the `isRequired` prop.
If the field has a label, a required indicator will appear next to it.

<Story of={Stories.Required} />

## Read only

The `isReadOnly` boolean prop makes the Input's text content immutable.
Unlike `isDisabled`, the Input remains focusable and the contents can still be copied.
See the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) for more information.

<Story of={Stories.ReadOnly} />

## Full width

The `fullWidth` prop will make an input fit to its parent width.

<Story of={Stories.FullWidth} />

## Label placement and alignment

Use `labelPlacement` and `labelAlign` props to set the position of the label.

See [Create a form](#create-a-form) story for a two column form with a shared label column.

<Story of={Stories.LabelPlacementAlignment} />

## Value

### Default value

An Input's value is empty by default, but an initial, uncontrolled, value can be provided using the `defaultValue` prop.

<Story of={Stories.DefaultValue} />

### Controlled value

The `value` prop can be used to make the value controlled.
The `onChange` event is fired when the user edits the text, and receives the new value.

<Story of={Stories.ControlledValue} />

## Autofill

See the example when an input has its value autofilled by the browser.

<Story of={Stories.Autofill} />

## Password

See the example of how to present the component with a password input.

<Story of={Stories.Password} />

## Validation

Input supports HTML validation attributes, custom validation logic, server errors,
and can be integrated with external form libraries. See the [Forms](?path=/docs/forms--docs) guide for details.

<Story of={Stories.Validation} />

## Create a form

See example of a two column CSS Grid form. The label is on the side
at the start of the text direction and the control is in the next column.
All rows share one label column with fixed or fractional width.

<Story of={Stories.CreateForm} />
