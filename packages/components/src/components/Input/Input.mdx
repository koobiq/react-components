# Input

<Status variant="experimental" />

Input component is a component that is used to get user input in a text field.

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

<Props />

## Addons

You can add an extra content using the `startAddon` and `endAddon` property.

<Story of={Stories.Addons} />

## Variant

To change the visual state of the input, use the `variant` property.

<Story of={Stories.Variant} />

## Error

The `error` property toggles the error state. The `errorMessage` shows a message to explain the error to the user.

<Story of={Stories.Error} />

## Disabled

An input can be disabled by passing the `disabled` property.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Required

To make a field required, add the `required` property.
If the field has a label, a required indicator will appear next to it.

<Story of={Stories.Required} />

## Read only

The `readonly` boolean property makes the Input's text content immutable.
Unlike `disabled`, the Input remains focusable and the contents can still be copied.
See the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) for more information.

<Story of={Stories.ReadOnly} />

## Full width

The `fullWidth` property will make an input fit to its parent width.

<Story of={Stories.FullWidth} />

## Value

### Default value

A Input's value is empty by default, but an initial, uncontrolled, value can be provided using the `defaultValue` property.

<Story of={Stories.DefaultValue} />

### Controlled value

The `value` property can be used to make the value controlled.
The `onChange` event is fired when the user edits the text, and receives the new value.

<Story of={Stories.ControlledValue} />

## Autofill

See the example when an input has its value autofilled by the browser.

<Story of={Stories.Autofill} />

## Composition

See the example showing the use of the component with others.

<Story of={Stories.Composition} />
