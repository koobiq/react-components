# Calendar

<Status variant="experimental" />

Provides the behavior and accessibility implementation for a calendar component.
A calendar displays one or more date grids and allows users to select a single date.

```tsx
import { Calendar } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Value

A Calendar has no selection by default. An initial, uncontrolled value can be
provided to the Calendar using the `defaultValue` prop. Alternatively, a controlled value
can be provided using the `value` prop.

Date values are provided using objects in the
[@internationalized/date](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/tree/main/packages/@internationalized/date) package.
This library handles correct international date manipulation across calendars,
time zones, and other localization concerns.

<Story of={Stories.Value} />

## Locale

By default, the calendar uses the user's system locale.
To set a custom locale, wrap your component with [Provider](?path=/docs/components-provider--docs) and pass the locale prop.

<Story of={Stories.Locale} />

## Disabled

The `isDisabled` boolean prop makes the Calendar disabled. Cells cannot be focused or selected.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Min and Max values

By default, Calendar allows selecting any date. The `minValue` and `maxValue` props can also be used to prevent
the user from selecting dates outside a certain range.

<Story of={Stories.MinMaxValues} />

## Unavailable dates

Calendar supports marking certain dates as unavailable.
These dates remain focusable with the keyboard so that navigation is consistent,
but cannot be selected by the user.

The `isDateUnavailable` prop accepts a callback that is called to evaluate
whether each visible date is unavailable.

<Story of={Stories.UnavailableDates} />

## Controlling the focused date

By default, the selected date is focused when a Calendar first mounts.
If no `value` or `defaultValue` prop is provided, then the current date is focused.
However, Calendar supports controlling which date is focused using the `focusedValue` and `onFocusChange` props.
This also determines which month is visible. The `defaultFocusedValue` prop allows setting the initial focused date when the Calendar
first mounts, without controlling it.
