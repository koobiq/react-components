# ProgressBar

<Status variant="experimental" />

ProgressBar shows either determinate or indeterminate progress of an operation over time.

```tsx
import { ProgressBar } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Value

ProgressBars are controlled with the `value` property.
By default, the value property represents the current percentage of progress,
as the minimum and maximum values default to 0 and 100, respectively.

<Story of={Stories.Value} />

Alternatively, a different scale can be used by setting the `minValue` and `maxValue` properties.

<Story of={Stories.MinMaxValues} />

## Indeterminate

By default, ProgressBars are determinate. Use `variant` property as `indeterminate` when progress can't be calculated against a specific goal.

<Story of={Stories.Indeterminate} />

## Loading emulation

See the example with progress loading emulation.

<Story of={Stories.LoadingEmulation} />
