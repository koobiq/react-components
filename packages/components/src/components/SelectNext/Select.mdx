# SelectNext

<Status variant="experimental" />

A select displays a collapsible list of options and allows a user to select one or more of them.

```tsx
import { Select } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Content

Select accepts static and dynamic collections.The examples above show static collections,
which can be used when the full list of options is known ahead of time.
Dynamic collections, as shown below, can be used when the options come from an external
data source such as an API call, or update over time.

As seen below, an iterable list of options is passed to the `Select` using the `items` prop.
Each item accepts an `key` prop, which is passed to the `onSelectionChange` handler to identify
the selected item. Alternatively, if the item objects contain an key property, as shown
in the example below, then this is used automatically and an `key` prop is not required.

<Story of={Stories.Content} />

## Single Selection

Setting a selected option can be done by using the `defaultSelectedKey` or `selectedKey` prop.
The selected key corresponds to the `key` prop of an item.

<Story of={Stories.SingleSelection} />

## Multiple Selection

You can use the `selectionMode="multiple"` prop to allow multiple selection.

<Story of={Stories.MultipleSelection} />

### Selected value tags

In `selectionMode="multiple"`, selected values are displayed as tags by default.

To control how tags are displayed, use the `selectedTagsOverflow` prop. It supports the following values:

- `responsive` (default) — tags collapse into a summary (e.g., "3 more") to fit the available width without increasing the component block size.
- `multiline` — tags wrap to multiple lines, increasing the component height as needed.

<Story of={Stories.SelectedTagsOverflow} />

## Invalid

The `isInvalid` prop toggles the error state. The `errorMessage` shows a message to explain the error to the user.

<Story of={Stories.Invalid} />

## Disabled

When the select component is disabled, it cannot be interacted with.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Disabled options

Select supports marking items as disabled using the `disabledKeys` prop.
Each key in this list corresponds with the `key` prop passed to the `Select.Item` component.

<Story of={Stories.DisabledOptions} />

## Required

To make a select required, add the `isRequired` prop.
If the field has a label, a required indicator will appear next to it.

<Story of={Stories.Required} />

## Full width

The `fullWidth` prop will make a select fit to its parent width.

<Story of={Stories.FullWidth} />

## Label placement and alignment

Use `labelPlacement` and `labelAlign` props to set the position of the label.

See the [Form](?path=/docs/components-form--docs#visual-options) for a two-column layout with labels on the side and a shared label column.

<Story of={Stories.LabelPlacementAlignment} />

## Clear Button

If you pass the `isClearable` prop to the select, it will have a clear
button which will be visible only when a value is selected.

<Story of={Stories.ClearButton} />

## Addons

You can add an extra content using the `startAddon` and `endAddon` props.

<Story of={Stories.Addons} />

## No items

If no items are available, the component shows a message in the dropdown list.
You can customize this message — either as plain text or a component — using the `noItemsText` prop.

<Story of={Stories.NoItems} />

## Searchable

<Story of={Stories.Searchable} />

## Open

### Default open

Select isn't opened by default. The `defaultOpen` prop can be used to set the default state.

### Controlled open

The `isOpen` prop can be used to make the opened state controlled. The `onOpenChange` event is fired when the select's open state changes.

<Story of={Stories.Open} />

## Section

A select component can display items grouped together in sections.

<Story of={Stories.Section} />

## With icons

See the example below how to use [icons](?path=/docs/icons--docs) in items of the component.

<Story of={Stories.WithIcons} />

## With item details

See the example below for using details in items of the component.

<Story of={Stories.WithItemDetails} />

## Asynchronous Loading

Select supports loading data asynchronously, and will display a progress circle when the `isLoading` prop is set.
It also supports infinite scrolling to load more data on demand as the user scrolls, via the `onLoadMore` prop.

<Story of={Stories.AsynchronousLoading} />
