# Table

<Status variant="experimental" />

A table displays data in rows and columns and enables a user to navigate its contents
via directional navigation keys, and optionally supports row selection.

```tsx
import { Table } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Links

Table rows may also be links to another page or website.
This can be achieved by passing the `href` prop to the `Table.Row` component.

<Story of={Stories.Links} />

## Divider

You can add row dividers to the table by using the `divider` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Divider} />

## Full width

The `fullWidth` prop will make a table fit to its parent width.

<Story of={Stories.FullWidth} />

## Dynamic Collection

So far, our examples have shown static collections,
where the data is hard coded. Dynamic collections, as shown below, can be used when
the table data comes from an external data source such as an API, or updates over time.
In the example below, both the columns and the rows are provided to the table via a render function.
You can also make the columns static and only the rows dynamic.

<Story of={Stories.DynamicCollection} />

## Sticky Header

The `stickyHeader` prop lets you fix the table's header so that when you scroll through the table's content,
the header always stays visible. This makes it much easier to work with tables containing lots of data.

<Story of={Stories.StickyHeader} />

## Alignment

You can set horizontal and vertical alignment for the `Table.Column`
and `Table.Cell` components using the `align` and `valign` props.

<Story of={Stories.Alignment} />

## Selection

### Single

<Story of={Stories.SingleSelection} />

### Multiple

<Story of={Stories.MultiSelection} />

### Controlled selection

<Story of={Stories.ControlledSelection} />

### Disabled rows

<Story of={Stories.DisabledRows} />

### Row actions

<Story of={Stories.RowActions} />
