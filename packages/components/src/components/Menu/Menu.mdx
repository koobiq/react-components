# Menu

<Status variant="experimental" />

A menu displays a list of actions or options that a user can choose.

```tsx
import { Menu } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Subcomponents

The component has the following helper components:

- `Menu.Header` — menu header component
- `Menu.Divider` — menu divider component
- `Menu.Item` — menu item component
- `Menu.Section` — a group of menu items
- `Menu.ItemText` — component to show text in a menu item.

## Content

The `Menu` accepts both static and dynamic collections,
so it can display options you know ahead of time or ones that arrive or change later.
For dynamic collections, just pass your items via the items prop and give each a unique `key`;
when you click an option, the Menu calls `onAction` with that `key`.

<Story of={Stories.Content} />

## Selection

Menu supports multiple selection modes.
By default, selection is disabled, however this can be changed using the `selectionMode` prop.
Use `defaultSelectedKeys` to provide a default set of selected items (uncontrolled)
and `selectedKeys` to set the selected items (controlled).
The value of the selected keys must match the `key` prop of the items.

### Single

<Story of={Stories.SelectionSingle} />

### Multiple

<Story of={Stories.SelectionMultiple} />

## Links

By default, interacting with an item in a Menu triggers `onAction` and optionally
`onSelectionChange` depending on the `selectionMode`.
Alternatively, items may be links to another page or website.
This can be achieved by passing the `href` prop to the `Menu.Item` component.
Link items in a menu are not selectable.

<Story of={Stories.Links} />

## Sections

Menu supports sections with headings in order to group options.
Sections can be used by wrapping groups of `Menu.Item` in a `Menu.Section` component.
Each `Menu.Section` takes a `title` and `key` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Sections} />

## Disabled items

Menu supports marking items as disabled using the `disabledKeys` prop.
Each key in this list corresponds with the key prop passed to the `Menu.Item` component,
or automatically derived from the values passed to the items prop.

## Placement

The menu's placement with respect to its anchor element can be adjusted
using the `placement` prop. See a full list of available placement
combinations in the [table of properties](#props). Menus
will also automatically flip to the opposite direction if there isn't enough space.

<Story of={Stories.Placement} />

## Open

### Default open

Menu isn't opened by default. The `defaultOpen` prop can be used to set the default state.

### Controlled open

The `open` prop can be used to make the opened state controlled.
The `onOpenChange` event is fired when the menu's open state changes.
