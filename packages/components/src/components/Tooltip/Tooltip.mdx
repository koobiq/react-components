# Tooltip

<Status variant="experimental" />

Tooltips display informative text when users hover over or focus on.

```tsx
import { Tooltip } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Usage

The best way to use a tooltip's control in most cases is to use
the `control` render function with the `TooltipPropControl` type.

The render function provides control props for managing the tooltip.
Pass these props to your component.

The `children` prop is `ReactNode` type.

```tsx
import { Button, Tooltip } from '@koobiq/react-components';

<Tooltip control={() => <Button>Hover me</Button>}>Content</Tooltip>;
```

You can also use controlled state to open the component and place the control element outside
the component. For this, see the [Controlled open state](#controlled-open-state) section.

## Variant

To change the visual state of the tooltip, use the `variant` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Variant} />

## Disabled

The `isDisabled` prop can be provided to a Tooltip to disable the tooltip, without disabling the control it displays on.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

## Arrow

By default, the tooltip has an arrow pointing to the anchor element.
When `hideArrow` is set to `true`, the tooltip appears without this arrow, making it looks like a floating box.

<Story of={Stories.Arrow} />

## Placement

The tooltip's placement with respect to its anchor element can be adjusted
using the `placement` prop. See a full list of available placement
combinations in the [table of properties](#props). Tooltips will also automatically flip to the opposite direction
if there isn't enough space.

<Story of={Stories.Placement} />

## Trigger

By default, tooltips appear both on hover and on focus.
The `trigger` prop can be set to "focus" to display the tooltip only on focus, and not on hover.

<Story of={Stories.Trigger} />

## Delays

Tooltips appear after a short delay when hovering the trigger, or instantly when using keyboard focus.
This delay can be adjusted for hover using the `delay` prop.

Tooltips disappear after a short delay when no longer hovering the trigger, or instantly when using keyboard focus.
This delay can be adjusted for hover using the `closeDelay` prop.

<Story of={Stories.Delays} />

## Offsets

The tooltip's offset with respect to its anchor element can be
adjusted using the `offset` and `crossOffset` props. The `offset` prop
controls the spacing applied along the main axis between the element and its
anchor element whereas the `crossOffset` prop handles the spacing applied along the cross axis.

<Story of={Stories.Offsets} />

## Controlled open state

The open state of the tooltip can be controlled via the `defaultOpen` and `isOpen` props.

<Story of={Stories.ControlledOpen} />

## Portal container

Use `portalContainer` prop to determine the target DOM node for overlay rendering.

<Story of={Stories.PortalContainer} />
