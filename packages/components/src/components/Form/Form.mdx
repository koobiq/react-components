# Form

<Status variant="experimental" />

Forms allow users to enter data that can be submitted while providing alignment and styling for form controls.

```tsx
import { Form } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Events

The `onSubmit` event will be triggered when a user submits the form with the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key
or by pressing a submit button. The `onReset` event will be triggered when a user presses a reset button.

<Story of={Stories.Events} />

## Validation

Form supports native HTML constraint validation with customizable UI, custom validation functions,
and server-side validation. Server-side validation errors can be provided via the
`validationErrors` prop as an object mapping field names to error messages,
which are cleared when the user modifies the field.

<Story of={Stories.Validation} />

See the [Forms](?path=/docs/forms--docs) guide to learn more about form validation,
including client-side validation, and integration with other frameworks and libraries.

### Validation Behavior

Form validation uses native validation behavior by default, but can be switched to ARIA validation
by setting `validationBehavior="aria"`. ARIA validation shows realtime errors without blocking submission.
This can be set at the form or field level.

<Story of={Stories.ValidationBehavior} />

## Visual options

### Label position and alignment

Form elements such as Input, Textarea, Select, and others support configuration
of label placement and alignment. You can also define the `labelPosition` and `labelAlignment`
props on the `Form` component to apply them consistently across all fields.

Using the Form component makes it easier to build forms with a shared label column,
so all labels line up neatly in one place.

<Story of={Stories.LabelPlacementAlignment} />

### Label inline size

When `labelPosition="side"` is used, you can set the width of the label column with the `labelInlineSize` prop.

<Story of={Stories.LabelInlineSize} />

### Disabled

All form fields can be disabled at once by setting the `isDisabled` prop on the `Form` component.

<Story of={Stories.Disabled} />

### Read only

All form fields can be read only at once by setting the `isReadOnly` prop on the `Form` component.

<Story of={Stories.ReadOnly} />

### Responsive values

You can switch the props' value based on the active breakpoint for each item.

<Story of={Stories.ResponsiveValues} />

Responsive values is supported by:

- `labelPosition`
- `labelAlignment`
- `labelInlineSize`
