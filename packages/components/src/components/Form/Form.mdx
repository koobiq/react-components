# Form

<Status variant="experimental" />

A form is a group of inputs that allows users to submit data to a server, with support for providing field validation errors.

```tsx
import { Form } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Events

The `onSubmit` event will be triggered when a user submits the form with the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key
or by pressing a submit button. The `onReset` event will be triggered when a user presses a reset button.

<Story of={Stories.Events} />

## Validation

Form supports native HTML constraint validation with customizable UI, custom validation functions,
and server-side validation. Server-side validation errors can be provided via the
`validationErrors` prop as an object mapping field names to error messages,
which are cleared when the user modifies the field.

<Story of={Stories.Validation} />

## Validation Behavior

Form validation uses native validation behavior by default, but can be switched to ARIA validation
by setting `validationBehavior="aria"`. ARIA validation shows realtime errors without blocking submission.
This can be set at the form or field level.

<Story of={Stories.ValidationBehavior} />
