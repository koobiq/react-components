# Provider

<Status variant="experimental" />

Wrap your application in a `Provider` to configure the general settings of your project, such as breakpoints, localization, etc.

```tsx
import { Provider } from '@koobiq/react-components';
```

<Story of={Stories.Base} />

## Props

<Props />

## Breakpoints

The Provider component can be used to set the responsive breakpoints for your application,
which are used by layout components and style props of all components within the Provider.

```js
export const defaultBreakpoints: Breakpoints = {
  xs: 0, // (min-width: 0px)
  s: 480, // (min-width: 480px)
  m: 768, // (min-width: 768px)
  l: 1024, // (min-width: 1024px)
  xl: 1280, // (min-width: 1280px)
  xxl: 1536 // (min-width: 1536px)
};
```

These breakpoints can be overridden by passing the `breakpoints` prop to the Provider component.
For more information, see the [Responsive UI](?path=/docs/responsive-ui--docs).

<Story of={Stories.Breakpoints} />

## Localization

Another important setting for your application is the locale.
By default, our library chooses the locale matching the user's browser/operating system language,
but this can be overridden with the `locale` prop if you have an application specific setting.

To determine the current locale in your component, import and use the `useLocale` hook from the library:

```tsx
import { useLocale } from '@koobiq/react-components';

const { locale } = useLocale();
```

<Story of={Stories.Localization} />

## Client side routing

The Provider component accepts an optional `router` prop.
This enables Koobiq React components that render links to perform client
side navigation using your application or framework's client side router.

```tsx
let navigate = useNavigateFromYourRouter();

<Provider router={{ navigate }}>
  <YourApp />
</Provider>;
```
